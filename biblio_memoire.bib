These models took off in the eighties and early nineties alongside object-oriented models. Their influence gradually died out with the emergence of other database models, in particular geographical, spatial, semistructured, and {XML}. Recently, the need to manage information with graph-like nature has reestablished the relevance of this area. The main objective of this survey is to present the work that has been conducted in the area of graph database modeling, concentrating on data structures, query languages, and integrity constraints.},

This book provides a long overdue reassessment of his papacy and his achievements, bringing together thirteen essays which review existing scholarship and present the latest research and new perspectives. Individual chapters cover topics such as Alexander's many contributions to the law of the Church, which had a major impact upon Western society, notably on marriage, his relations with Byzantium, and the extension of papal authority at the peripheries of the West, in Spain, Northern Europe and the Holy Land. But dominant are the major clashes between secular and spiritual authority: the confrontation between Henry {II} of England and Thomas Becket after which Alexander eventually secured the king's co-operation and the pope's eighteen-year conflict with the German emperor, Frederick I. Both the papacy and the Western Church emerged as stronger institutions from this struggle, largely owing to Alexander's leadership and resilience: he truly mastered the art of survival.},

The book opens with an orientation, giving the reader a history of data modeling in the humanities and a grounding in the technical concepts necessary to understand and engage with the second part of the book. The second part of the book is a wide-ranging exploration of topics central for a deeper understanding of data modeling in digital humanities. Chapters cover data modeling standards and the role they play in shaping digital humanities practice, traditional forms of modeling in the humanities and how they have been transformed by digital approaches, ontologies which seek to anchor meaning in digital humanities resources, and how data models inhabit the other analytical tools used in digital humanities research. It concludes with a glossary chapter that explains specific terms and concepts for data modeling in the digital humanities context. This book is a unique and invaluable resource for teaching and practising data modeling in a digital humanities context.},

In detail, the approach here described adopts a bi-dimensional vision: considering the model as both a process of abstraction, an interpretation from a certain point of view, and a formal language to implement this abstraction in order to create something processable by a machine. The role of conceptual models – to be converted into ontologies – as a semantic deepening of controlled vocabularies, is the translation of this vision. Ontologies are the models used in domain communities in order to share classes and predicates for conceptual interoperability. Thinking of data models as a knowledge organization system is the core of this reflection on Digital Humanities domain.},

However, due to their steadily increasing number and their heterogeneity, it is difficult to ensure the sustainability and durability of this kind of living systems from an organizational point of view. This paper describes a project for the preservation of specialized web-based research applications in the humanities. The {SustainLife} project investigates to what extent methods and technologies of professional cloud deployment and provisioning strategies can be applied to problems of long-term availability of research software as they are omnipresent in humanities data centers such as the Data Center for the Humanities ({DCH}) at the University of Cologne. Technological basis of the project is the {OASIS} standard {TOSCA} and the Open Source implementation {OpenTOSCA}, respectively, which was developed at the Institute for Architecture of Application Systems ({IAAS}) at the University of Stuttgart. In the course of the project selected use cases from the field of Digital Humanities ({DH}) will be modeled in {TOSCA} to be able to automatically deploy them upon request at any time. The {TOSCA} standard enables a portable description of the modeled systems independent of specific providers to facilitate their long-term availability. The aim is to provide system components described in the use cases in a component library, as well as in the form of {TOSCAcompliant} application templates to make them available for reuse in other {DH} projects.},

In an era without formal representation, the ability to persuade audiences of particular views of the past could be a significant weapon for those seeking to gain rhetorical leverage in political disputes. Yet “useful” history could be compiled from existing works as well as written from scratch. Because of the technologies of transmission in the age before printing, texts were essentially unstable: even authoritative works were vulnerable to editing and repackaging by copyists in ways that could fundamentally alter their original meanings. Moreover, because of the organization of manuscript production, historical compilations were more likely to reflect the views of communities rather than individual authors. Modern historians have observed that the Carolingian and Anglo-Norman periods, both of which witnessed a revival of interest in the writing of new history, also saw surges in the production of historical compilations that functioned as responses to high-level political events and contributed to the formation of social identities.},

	abstract = {Charters are of crucial importance as a source when studying the history of the Middle Ages and the early modern era. There
are a number of projects aiming at making charters available in digital format. All of these projects, as far as they use
{XML} as the technological basis for their work, were represented at a conference in April 2004. It was found that, despite
some structural differences in the individual approaches, there is considerable potential for integration as regards the individual
charter as a legally relevant text. This potential can be tapped by using common standards for the tagging/encoding of charters.
This article presents a proposal for such a standard. The proposed standard follows the existing {TEI} standard, but also contains
a number of significant enhancements. The article also looks at the problems caused by overlapping structures and presents
an architecture for a search engine that could help to bring together charters from all over Europe.},

	abstract = {This chapter discusses the current trends in research on not only {SQL} ({NoSQL}) languages and systems. It focuses on the language aspect of {NoSQL} systems, and highlights two main trends in French research that pertains to {NoSQL} languages and systems. The first trend aims to add support for well-known, relational operations to {NoSQL} databases. The second trend of research is aimed at unifying {NoSQL} systems, in particular their query languages. Data processing operations generally consist of filtering, aggregation and grouping and exposing a {MapReduce}-like interface. Most {NoSQL} databases do not support join operations, rather they rely on data denormalization to achieve similar results, at the cost of more storage usage and more maintenance effort. While relational databases started both from a formal foundation and solid implementations, {NoSQL} databases have developed rapidly as implementation artifacts.},

Much of our work is now reliant upon the use of resources such as databases, online research tools and digital editions. Libraries and archives are undertaking programmes of ‘mass digitisation’, making our primary sources available to view as digital images on the web. This article presents a view of the current landscape as well as thoughts for the future of digital research for scholars in the humanities. It considers four aspects of sustainability (technological, financial, environmental and ‘human’), and offers a new working definition for digital sustainability in this context. This centres on sustainability not just as a technical concern but as a multifaceted activity within which humanities researchers can play a crucial role.},

@article{allam_user_nodate,
	title = {User Experience: Challenges and Opportunities},
	abstract = {User expectations, motivations and feelings when using a product or encountering a system have urged the need to investigate beyond the traditional functionality and usability concerns by assessing and designing for the user experience. Having this realized, we can ensure positive user experience as well as desirable products. This paper aims at providing an overview of the main concepts and principles related to user experience. The topics discussed in this paper cover both theories from the academia as well as empirical studies from the industry. Due to misconception of user experience, it was found that industry depends on and uses the traditional usability methods in the product development as user experience practices. As a result, this paper discusses and elaborates the relationship between conventional usability and user experience in addition to the variety of methods which can be used for user experience evaluation during different time spans. Furthermore, user experience extends over different areas such as human computer interaction, and product design and development. Knowledge and concepts related to user experience are scattered due to the dynamic concepts of user experience. In other words, authors tend to discuss the user experience from their own perspective and interest. Hence, this paper is trying to provide and establish a holistic understanding of the user experience by covering different topics related to user experience. The output of this paper may provide and assist researchers and practitioners to establish a base to aid in proper understanding of user experience, its concepts and principles.},

The costs of digital scholarship are frequently posed in terms of human labor and rights abuses, ecological and environmental damage, carbon footprints, waste of resources associated with obsolescence, and other issues that affect every stage of the lifecycle of production. But sustainability also needs to be understood as an epistemic concept embedded in complex systems, not merely as a set of problems to be solved through instrumental means applied to operational logistics. This article addresses mechanistic approaches to sustainability, while suggesting that the complexity of the concept of sustainability requires the humanistic methods and ethical principles to be engaged in decisions about future practices in pedagogy, research, and institutional sites.},
